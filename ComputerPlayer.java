	 * Here, you should write a method that will print a sequence of moves to solve the GameOf15. Finally,
	 * return the solved GameOf15.
	 * 
	 * However, you don't have to solve the entire game, you merely have to get the blank space
	 * into the right place.
	 * 
	 * In other words, if your board looks like this:
	 * 
	 * 1 	13	6	2	
     * 5 	8	10	4	
     * 9 	7	3	11	
     * 14	15		12 
	 * 
	 * then you need to make only one move (left!!!), in order to get this board:
	 * 
	 * 1 	13	6	2	
     * 5 	8	10	4	
     * 9 	7	3	11	
     * 14 	15	12	
     * 
	 * You **must** not modify GameOf15.java for this part.
	 * 
	 * Print out each move on its own line using the same letters as before.
	 * u -- move up
	 * d -- move down
	 * l -- move left (that's an L, not an I)
	 * r -- move right
	 * 
	 * @return the solved game of 15 board

	/**
	 * BONUS QUESTION
	 * 
     * Solving the entire board can be done for an extra credit! 
     * We suggest you to try and solve the entire board with some help from Google, as some of
     * the algorithms can be pretty complex. One option (not the easiest) 
     * is to use the A* search algorithm.
     * 
     * This might help you get started: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/94975/how-do-you-solve-the-15-puzzle-with-a-star-or-dijkstras-algorithm
